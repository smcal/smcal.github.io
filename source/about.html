        <h2>California Wildfires from 1992 - 2015</h2>
        <p>This visualization is the final project for Summer 2018 session of CS-498 Data Visualization.  The user
        is presented with a drill down story that informs the user on the types of wildfires that have occurred
        in the period of 1992 - 2015.  The user can see the total number of acres that have burned during that period
        and they can interactively investigate individual causes, individual years or both.  There is also a map
        of California that maps the locations of the fires for a particular year and the tooltips inform the user
        of the official name of the fire as well as the number of acres burned.  This visualization could assist
        the user in determining trends as to which causes are prevalent during certain months.</p>
        <p>Note: This data set is quite large and some of the views when making changes to either year or cause may
        take a couple seconds to redisplay.  I originally was planning on doing this for the whole United States
        but with almost 2 million records it would take a large amount of time to redisplay elements.  I wanted to use
        the crossfilter library to handle this data but when a piazza post mentioned we were not allow to use it
        I limited the data only to California.  For this reason the map portion does not have zooming capability.
        Even on a fast computer zooming was frustrating so I cut that feature out.</p>

                <h2>Scenes</h2>
                <p>The main scene is presented as the first page of the website.  It is an overview consisting of the total acres
                burned in California.  By default the total acres for all years is displayed.  From there the user
                can choose any year to get the number of acres burned in that specific year.  I applied Tufte's rules
                of minimalism by only showing the bar chart and presenting a tooltip with all the necessary
                information when the user mouses over a column.</p>
                <p>From here the user can choose the other scenes in any order they choose.  The second scene
                presented is a monthly view where the user can select both the year and the cause of the fire
                (taken directly from the data) and see the number of acres burned per month.  This allows the user
                to determine if there is a pattern as to when certain types of causes are more prevalent at certain
                months.  For example summer seems to be a favorite for arsonists.</p>
                <p>The final scene is map of California with an overlay of the location of the fires.  The user
                can choose both the year and the cause of the fire to see the actual location of the fire.  Mousing
                over the location circles brings up a tooltip with the fire name the size and the year it occurred.  I
                did not include and all years for two reasons, first it took about thirty seconds for the data to display
                and when it did it covered the whole map.  Since zooming could not be provided as noted above it is
                limited to just a year and a cause.  This visualization is useful since the user can geographically
                see the most common areas where fires occur (Lightning is particularly interesting).</p>

                <h2>Annotaions</h2>
                <p>Every scene in this visualization has annotations.  The index page (Total from the menu bar).  There
                is title indicating what this chart displays and the title also changes when the user changes the year
                selection to point the year they have currently selected.  Also when mousing over the chart the user
                can see the values for acres burned.</p>
                <p>The Monthly chart has the same annotations as the Total chart but with an added axis at the
                bottom to make it easier to see the month for each bar.</p>
                <p>The Map has the same dynamic title as the other two for consistency.  Also the points overlayed on
                the map are a visual annotation to the user of the location on the map and a tooltip is presented as
                you mouse over the point displaying the official name of the fire if one exists as well the number of
                acres burned for that fire.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h2>Parameters</h2>
                <p>The main parameters for all the visualization are the year and the cause of the fire.  They are
                used as filters to allow the user to drill down to desired views.  These parameters are used to control
                the views and the annotations on the charts.  The paramteers are in the form of drop downs showing a list
                of all the allowable values.</p>
                <h2>Triggers</h2>
                <p>The triggers are controlled by dropdown lists that trigger events when the user makes a selection.  The
                dropdown is a common visual element and a note informs the user that by selecting a different value they
                can filter the chart.  For the bar charts the bars are sorted by size and that is shown visually by a
                transition.</p>
                <h2>Data Source</h2>
                <p>The data for this visualization was acquired from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires"
                target="_blank">Kaggle - US Wildfires</a> Because of the size of the data set (1.88 million records) I
                filtered it down to only show California.  The only other modification done to the data was to remove columns
                that were not going to be used so as to cut down on the size and to correct entry errors such as extra decimal
                points in certain lat/lon values (32..1234 for example)</p>
